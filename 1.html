  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for <strong>creating web pages</strong> and web applications. This format description is for HTML 5, standardized in two coordinated efforts. One is by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which maintains a specification for HTML as a modularized "living standard" at https://html.spec.whatwg.org/.   The second is at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). A series of snapshots of well-supported modules have been compiled and published as W3C Recommendations: 5.0 (2014); 5.1 (2016); 5.2 (2017). The latest W3C Recommendation is a result of a May 2019 agreement between W3C and the WHATWG regarding the development of a single version of the HTML specification. The specifics of the agreement can be found here and the latest recommendations for HTML can be found at the https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/. See Notes below for more on the relationship between W3C and WHATWG.

  A key objective for the WHATWG was backwards compatibility to ensure good rendering of existing websites. Another objective was that the specification be detailed enough that implementers such as browser developers can achieve complete interoperability without reverse-engineering. With these objectives in mind, the dependence of HTML on SGML was eliminated for HTML 5 and the specification includes details on how browsers are to render pages and how parsers are to handle shortcuts such as missing end tags. For example, the specification states that "A <tr> element’s end tag may be omitted if the <tr> element is immediately followed by another <tr> element, or if there is no more content in the parent element." HTML parsers/validators will accept these omissions. The specification also incorporates two serializations, the backwards-compatible HTML serialization (documented in 8. The HTML syntax) and a stricter XML-based serialization (documented in 9. The XML syntax), sometimes referred to as XHTML5, and compatible with the earlier W3C Recommendations for XHTML. The XML-based serialization requires the use of a different Internet media type and has different rules for declarations at the beginning of the document.
